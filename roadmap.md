# Roadmap

Implementation steps of the features described in [specs.md](specs.md). Each step is delivered in its own pull request, which checks its box.

## Reference

Read only by the steps that need them:

- [Technical choices](docs/technical-choices.md): the libraries, the services and the main designs, with their reasons.
- [Images](docs/images.md): the game images the application may show, and the rules of Grinding Gear Games.
- [poe2scout usage](docs/poe2scout-usage.md): the limits of the price database and the rules the application follows.
- [Trade site usage](docs/trade-site-usage.md): the risk accepted by the owner, the limits and the guardrails.
- [Roadmap archive](docs/roadmap-archive.md): the detail of the steps done.

## Path of Exile 2 1.0

Path of Exile 2 leaves early access with its version 1.0 on 2026-12-11. The modifiers, their tiers and ranges, the trade site data and maybe the format of the copied text can change. After this release:

- copy real items again (English and French) and rerun the parser tests;
- check the stat ids, the pseudo stats and the filters of the trade site, and the categories of poe2scout;
- check the tiers and ranges given by the advanced copy, and update the modifier tables.

- [x] **0. Mock-ups** (#4)
- [x] **1. Application window** (#5)
- [x] **2. Clipboard watching** (#7)
- [x] **3. Item parser** (#9)
- [x] **4. Interface language** (#10)
- [x] **5. Settings** (#11)
- [x] **6. Title bar** (#12, #13, #14)
- [x] **7. Price data** (#15, #16)
- [x] **8. French item names** (#17)
- [x] **9. Price display** (#18, #19)
- [x] **10. Item stats and filters** (#20, #23, #25, #26)
- [x] **11. Trade site client** (#28)
- [ ] **12. Offers display**, in two pull requests:
  - **12a, the offers block** (done, #29): search block, waiting and refresh block, offer rows with the seller status, suspicious offers, currency exchange offers, more offers, searching, long wait, no offer, unreachable and unidentified unique states, and the trade site part of the status bar. One `trade::search::OfferSearch` for the whole application: each one has its own limits and its own 10 s between searches.
  - **12b, the offer tooltip**: position, pin, roll differences (the average of a line with several numbers), Copy whisper (without a note on its language) and the hover of the rows, for the offers of items only; the spinner while more offers come and the message when they can't; the log filter that hides all the messages of `arboard` but its warnings and errors, which explain a whisper that couldn't be copied. Also the currencies of the price block moved to the left when a small amount is hidden.
- [ ] **13. Estimated prices**: the roll bar of the rare and magic modifiers over every tier; filters of the rare and magic items and jewels (pseudo totals, weapon DPS, base, item level; their minimums at 90 % of the copied value are there since 10b, and the range of every tier of a modifier keeps them within it) and of the normal items (base, sockets, item level, exceptional bases), estimated price from the median of the 5 cheapest similar offers, uncertainty warning; the template of each modifier line (`Adds # to # Lightning Damage`) to match it with the stat ids of the trade site (the filters of the uniques need them too: until then, a unique is searched by its name, base and corrupted state), and the item class as a type rather than a translated name.
- [ ] **14. Responsive layout and price history**: wireframes then mock-up of the medium and wide layouts with the visual style, then these layouts in the application, with the 7-day history chart in the wide layout.
- [ ] **15. Update notice**: at launch, ask the GitHub releases for the latest version, and when it is newer than the running one, a bubble "Version 0.2.0 available" with a link to its download page, closed for good per version (like the bubble of a new league); mock-up first. Needed before the first release: a player kept on an old version broken by a change of the game (Path of Exile 2 1.0, a new copied text format) or of the trade site wouldn't know it.
- [ ] **16. First release**: executable name (without the `rust-` prefix) and application id from one constant, application icon from the emblem, a readable message when the window can't open (no OpenGL, no X11 / XWayland), README usage (with where the log is), Wayland help, clipboard help and services called, version 0.1.0.
- [ ] **17. Overlay POC**: after the first release, a proof of concept of the price shown over the game, the strongest point of Exiled Exchange 2, to compete with it there too.
- [ ] **18. More settings**: after the first release, the settings the players may want, gathered while building the application; first, turning the pseudo stats on or off among the filters of the rare items (their default to decide then).
- [ ] **19. Automatic updates**: after the first release, if the application finds its players: the new version downloaded in the background and installed at the next launch, like Discord, with a signature checked before installing anything; Velopack (a real installer for Windows and macOS) or the `self_update` crate (the executable replaced), and Flathub for Linux, whose system updates it; to decide with the installers of the first release.
- [ ] **20. Polish**: the last touches, at the very end: a tooltip on the DPS of a weapon telling it counts its quality, modifiers and runes ("With its quality, modifiers and runes"), so that it isn't taken for the DPS of the base.
